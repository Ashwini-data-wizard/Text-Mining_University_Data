            "Set clear expectations (in writing) and communicate the relevance of any given assignment or activity.\n",

Alternatively, if a learning objective is to help students structure and refine the presentation of arguments in writing, a GenAI system might play a supportive role in the process of students' learning how to organize an argument in written form (which is not the same as a student trying to use a GenAI system to formulate the substantive claimwith accompanying reasoning and evidencethat is being structured in written form). \n",

In addition to including a GenAI course policy on the syllabus and explicit details about GenAI use in assignment instructions, we encourage faculty and GE instructors to talk explicitly with students about the rationale for their policy and expectations, including the relationship to students learning, as suggested above.\n",

            "GenAI models carry implicit biases in them that make them unsuitable for use in cases of ethical deliberation and decision, and should not be used in those circumstances. Furthermore, this data is from the past, which results in a loss of context for current social changes.\n",
            "GenAI can mislead:  \n",
            "GenAI in its current stage will tend to hallucinate or make up random data that is not true. Models have no real sense of what is true or false. These models are built to output what is most likely in a verbose manner, even if there might not be enough real information to back it up.\n",
            "GenAI prefers English:  \n",
            "LLM models are currently heavily biased toward Standard American English. This means that writing styles and dialects adopted by other cultures and ethnic groups such in cases of African American or Indigenous English are at risk of being penalized for a privileged White-dominated form of writing instead.\n",

Use those articles to find other articles that consider the same question (review the citation list for other articles to read). Either before or after you ask ChatGPT a question, try a google search with the same sort of query and see what it turns up; also, try a search on the OSU library system.

            "Michigan State University Interim Guidance on Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Instructional Settings As you prepare for the Fall 2023 academic semester, our hopes are that instructors will 1) develop a course-level generative AI use policy and actively discuss with students about expectations for generative AI use in the work for your class, 2) promote equitable and inclusive use of the technology, and 3) work with colleagues across campus to determine ethical and scholarly applications of generative AI for preparing students to succeed in an evolving digital landscape. The following materials were assembled using existing MSU policy documents and include framing questions developed by an interdisciplinary team of campus experts.  Develop and actively communicate your course-level generative AI policy 1. Consider how AI technology might compel you to revise your course assignments, quizzes, and tests to avoid encouraging unethical or dishonest use of generative AI. 2. Develop and integrate a generative AI policy throughout the course resources:  Provide clear definitions, expectations, and repercussions of what will happen if students violate the policy.  Explain the standards of academic integrity in the course, especially as related to use of AI technologies, and review the Integrity of Scholarship and Grades Policy.  Be clear about what types of AI are acceptable and what versions of the technology students can use or not use.  Put this policy into D2L and any assignment instructions consistently. 3. Discuss these expectations when talking about course policies at the beginning of the course and remind students about them as you discuss course assignments:  Take time to explain to students the pros and cons of generative AI technologies relative to your course.  Explain the development of your policy and make clear the values, ethics, and philosophies underpinning its development.  Explain the repercussions of not following the course policy and submit an Academic Dishonesty Report if needed. 4. If you want to integrate AI in the classroom as an allowed or required resource:  Consult with MSU IT guidance about recommendations for use and adoption of generative AI technology, including guidelines for keeping you and your data safe.  Determine if MSU already has access to the tools you desire for free, and if not available through MSU, consider the cost and availability of the resources you will allow or require, and go through MSU's procurement process.  If you want to require students to use an AI technology that comes with a cost, put the resource into the scheduling system as you would a textbook, so students know that is an anticipated cost to them. Promote Equitable and Inclusive Use 1. Consider equity and inclusion when making decisions about AI use in your course. 1.1. How does the development and use of generative AI affect identity groups differentially? What biases exist within the development and use of generative AI? What are the potential challenges regarding AI from an equity-lens (e.g., historic issues with facial recognition and BIPOC populations)?  1.2. What data sources does generative AI use to generate a response, and how representative is this data source? 2. Consider how AI content and perspectives can enhance dialogue and collaboration between diverse disciplines, departments, and individuals. 3. Consider how integration of generative AI technologies into the classroom help or hinder students success. 4. Consider situations in which some students may have access to more advanced technology than others based on cost or other factors. 5. Consider if generative AI technology provides accommodation for certain populations and how its use may help achieve equity for persons with disabilities. Determine Ethical and Scholarly Use The determination of appropriate uses for generative AI can be facilitated through discussion with colleagues within and among disciplines. Discussions that can help our communities to answer 1. What is the ethical use of AI in society, in a given scholarly discipline, and in instruction? 2. How does generative AI pose ethical challenges to issues such as data security and privacy? 3. What types of information should and should not be inputted into an AI system? 4. When does generative AI-assistance become AI-ownership? What are the limits to using generative AI in support of academic work? 5. How should a student cite or disclose the use of generative AI relative to their academic work? 6. How does the course/instructor define plagiarism and academic dishonesty relate to AI? What are the penalties for not following the policy? Many philosophies and policies outlined on the OSSA Academic Integrity website already apply, and additional specific guidance is available on FAQs specifically addressing generative AI. AI as a complex issue requiring multiple perspectives and dialogue 1. How can generative AI technologies assist with collaborative, integrated, and interdisciplinary work in the classroom? 2. What is the appropriate use of generative AI in the subject-area and/or discipline to advance scholarship and maintain excellence? 3. What are the current uses, concerns, and dialogue relative to generative AI within the subject and/or discipline? 4. How will generative AI affect the unit/major/courses content, assignments, instructional objectives, learning outcomes, or assessment models? Might these outcomes need to change to account for AI technology? 5. How will generative AI influence job growth, skills, and responsibilities in the future? To help facilitate this work, the Center for Teaching and Learning Innovation (CTLI) and the Enhanced Digital Learning Initiative (EDLI) will be producing resources, offering workshops, and facilitating discussions throughout the year.

            "For those of you who are unfamiliar, Chat GPT3 is a Large Language Model tool developed by OpenAI. The tool was released in November 2022, is powered by large amounts of data (~175 billion parameters), and relies on deep neural networks to predict and generate text in response to user prompts. There is much debate about the quality of the text generated but there is both interest and concern related to AI-generated text.  Based on conversations to date, our faculty are simultaneously interested in learning how ChatGPT3 and similar chat bots might transform teaching, learning, and assessment in innovative ways, and concerned about students use of Chat GPT3 to answer test and exam questions and generate content for written papers and assignments. Below, we lay out a number of recommendations for our faculty.\n",

            "Faculty members might take time to experiment with ChatGPT[1] for themselves and discover the capabilities and limitations for their particular discipline and context. One way to become more familiar with ChatGPT is to submit your own writing prompts or assignment questions and examine the type and quality of text generated. Making multiple attempts can illuminate the range of text generated to the same prompt. In addition, dont be surprised if you get a message ChatGPT is at capacity right now.\n",
            "Faculty are encouraged to engage their colleagues and students in conversation about ChatGPT. This will help us to crowdsource both pedagogical opportunities and assessment concerns.  Some faculty plan to have students use ChatGPT to generate essays and then have students critique and improve those essays[2]. Other faculty are busy revisiting their assessment strategy and assignment particulars. Still others told us they plan to ask students to provide writing samples at the beginning of the semester.  Another indicated they planned to replace some writing assignments with oral presentations with Q&A, or contingently reserve the right to do so. \n",
            "Faculty are encouraged to amend their syllabus[3] to add a statement that explicitly addresses student use of ChatGPT or similar tools use that is consistent with their teaching and learning philosophy. Faculty should be transparent about what students are permitted to use and under what conditions. Faculty might consider requiring students to include brief acknowledgement statements with assignments, ones in which they share (and perhaps reflect on) which tools they used in the process of completing their work. Two divergent examples are provided below and additional samples will be accessible on the CETL syllabus template.\n",
            "Every faculty member should take advantage of this opportunity to reflect on their course and lesson learning outcomes and (re)consider the extent to which their assessment strategy is aligned to measure those learning outcomes, and to identify adjustments needed for existing assessments and opportunities for creating alternative authentic assessments.\n",
            "We believe maintaining a balanced and realistic perspective of the impacts of AI is more productive and appropriate than a narrow focus on surveillance and detection. While we believe that the vast majority of Uconn students are committed to the highest ideals of academic integrity, we also know that some students may be tempted to use ChatGPT3 and other tools in ways not permitted. For this reason, we wanted to let you know that the University administration is exploring various AI detection software that faculty could use to identify possible AI generated content. Until then, faculty may choose to use open source experimental detection applications such as GPTZero and AI Content Detector, being mindful that interpretation of results should be tempered by the fact that neither provide definitive evidence.\n",

            "ChatGPT Guidance for Instructors WHAT IS CHATGPT? ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that uses natural language processing techniques to respond to user-generated prompts. While other chatbots are typically limited to pre-programmed responses, ChatGPT can produce original responses in real time. ChatGPT can generate everything from essays and emails to poems and lesson plans. It can revise text with improved grammar and spelling or modulate the style or tone of a provided set of text, as requested by the user. ChatGPT is just one of many generative AI tools. ChatGPT may occasionally incorporate fabricated or incorrect information in its responses. Because of the way it operates, it is difficult to trace the source and provenance of information provided by ChatGPT (except when it is connected to the internet, e.g., Bingintegrated GPT). In addition, because ChatGPT was trained on a corpus of text that was originally written by humans, ChatGPTs responses may reflect the biases present in the text it was trained on. TIPS FOR INSTRUCTORS  Talk to students about your expectations for academic honesty. Many students who engage in academic dishonesty do so impulsively or without significant reflection on the choice. Anticipate this behavior by proactively engaging students in an open discussion about academic honesty in your course, including your expectations regarding ChatGPT. Remind students that they are required to follow UGAs Academic Honesty Policy and talk to your students about how that policy applies to your course. For example, is ChatGPT off-limits, sometimes OK to use, or always encouraged? See below for sample syllabus language related to ChatGPT, or explore the growing repository of classroom policies related to generative AI available here. Use of artificial intelligence or word mixing software to write your paper or disguise plagiarized work is considered unauthorized assistance in this course. Suspected unauthorized assistance, or other violations of UGAs A Culture of Honesty, will be reported to the Office of Academic Honesty. Or:   ChatGPT Guidance      Page 2 We encourage you to use AI tools to explore the field and help you study. However, you must take full responsibility for any AI-generated materials you incorporate in your course products. If you include AI-generated materials in your course products, it should be cited like any other reference material. All information incorporated into course products must be verified, ideas must still be attributed, and facts must be true.  Do not rely solely on AI detector tools (see the Additional Resources section at the end of this document for examples) to identify whether an assignment was created using generative AI. These tools can return false positives and fail to detect some AI-generated material. If you suspect a piece of work was completed using generative AI, carefully analyze the work. If you believe a violation of your course policies may have occurred, instructors should report the incident to the Office of Academic Honesty. A facilitated discussion will be scheduled for you to talk with the student about their process for completing the assignment and whether a violation occurred.  Consider the limitations of ChatGPT when designing course assignments. As of August 1, 2023, ChatGPT (v3.5): o cannot access information that is not already included in its corpus. This includes text or internet resources generated after 2021, notes or other specifics from your course. However, GPT4 and other GPT integrated products do have access to more updated information. o cannot dissect or produce non-text-based responses, although other AIgenerators can produce images and art. o may fabricate references (including contrived DOIs) when prompted to produce citations.  Instructors might deliberately ask students to engage with ChatGPT, or other Generative AI tools, as an educational endeavor. For example, students might analyze how ChatGPT generates text for different audiences, attempt to find the original sources of text used to generate a particular ChatGPT response, compare and contrast ChatGPT output in response to various prompts, or improve upon a given ChatGPT prompt. If you decide to incorporate use of generative AI tools in your course, inform students how/whether you would like them to document or cite their use of generative AI. Discuss with students the importance of transparency and trustworthiness to the process of generating knowledge, the pursuit of a degree, and to the ideals of higher education.   If you ask your students to use ChatGPT, review the privacy policy and provide an opt out. ChatGPT is currently released as a free research preview, meaning that current use of the tool is helping to improve it for future use. OpenAI (the company that designed ChatGPT) collects data from its users which may also be shared with third party entities. If you plan to use ChatGPT in an educational   ChatGPT Guidance      Page 3 setting, it is recommended that you review the privacy policy and terms of use with your students, and provide them with the option to opt out (or alternate means to engage with ChatGPT output) if they do not feel comfortable having their data collected and shared as stated in these policies. \n",

Some tools may use log-in data, tracking, and other analytics (Center for New Designs in Learning and Scholarship, 2023). This same advice applies to you, as a faculty member. Should you want to input your existing writing prompts into an AI tool to see the output, consider your own data privacy. Instructors who may want to make use of ChatGPT or other technology tools in their classes should note that, as with any online service that is not contracted by the university, in view of FERPA regulations, students must not be required to identify themselves to third parties.\n",

Instructors do have the discretion to allow for the use of such tools, however, and must do so explicitly if they want to allow it. Stating what you expect students to use (or not use) in their work helps to answer any questions around what extra support is permittable. Depending on your pedagogical values and course expectations, consider adopting or revising one of the statements below for your syllabus.

            "A. While there are emerging tools designed to detect AI-produced content (including Hugging Face, GPTZero, CrossPlag, and Turnitin), we recommend against relying on them for several reasons:\n",
            "These tools are not perfect.\n",
            "Their false positives may cause faculty to falsely identify a students own work as being AI-generated. Chasing down these false leads can waste time and inspire unnecessary mistrust between faculty and students.\n",
            "Their false negatives may cause faculty to falsely ascribe an AIs work to the student.\n",
            "B. These tools are generally only effective when the entire piece was produced by AI, but if the student has included some AI-generated work interspersed within their own words, it is much harder for these tools to detect.\n",
            "C. Students are already coming up with ways to beat AI-detection tools: one prominent approach is to ask one AI-generating tool (e.g., chatGPT) to create the first draft of an assignment, and then to ask another AI-generating tool (e.g., CopyGenius and Quillbot AI) to rephrase each paragraph, making it much harder to detect.\n",
            "D. AI-generating tools will evolve to evade AI-detecting tools, and then AI-detecting tools will evolve to get better at identifying AI-generated work. The arms race to detect AI-generated work and the time faculty spent staying current on the best AI-detection tools may have a higher cost than the benefit these tools provide.\n",
            "E. Some AI-generated tools, such as chatGPT, may develop watermarks that allow the text they generate to be easily identified, but as AI-generating tools proliferate, some students will migrate to tools that dont include these watermarks when they feel incentivized to do so.\n",
            "\n",
            "In sum, tools that claim to detect AI-generated work are easy for students to work around if they want to, and it can be easy for faculty to invest large amounts of time into policing their students instead of investing time into fostering student learning. Rather than relying on AI-detection software, we recommend designing assignments that foster student learning that cannot be replicated by AI-tools (such as in-class writing; peer review; small, frequent, personal essays; essays that cite scholarship in the field or classroom discussions; projects that involve interviews or original data original; essays that cite current events; assigning multi-modal assignments, podcasts, explainer videos, or any of the other principles outlined above.)\n",

            "In addition, some faculty may also want to use chatGPT in their course. For example, one can imagine that students can use chatGPT to apply concepts from class to generate initial ideas for papers or research projects, or to analyze and refine early drafts. Moreover, incorporating AI tools into ones course can also provide training and practice for students entering professional environments where the use of AI will be a relevant skill.\n",

            "Were navigating recent developments with AI in our classrooms at SCU. The Collaborative for Teaching Innovation hosted three demonstrations and conversations about Generative AI in Winter and Spring Quarters of 2023. Heres a summary of a few key points from these discussions. \n",
            "\n",
            "1) AI Tools Generate Information (but they don't analyze it, it may not be accurate, and they make stuff up)\n",
            "\n",
            "AI tools like ChatGPT are large language models (LLMs) that scour the internet for information and make connections between words and phrases. ChatGPT, in particular, has been used to complete writing tasks, generate Excel-related prompts, draft lab reports, and do coding assignments quickly. They often lack the sophistication, details, critical perspective, and specificity to course content and contexts that we expect in excellent student writing. For example, it can explain theoretical concepts well (because of an abundance of texts on the topic online), but it cannot generate a deeper analysis of the theory. It also cannot draw information from non-text modalities like videos, nor can it, obviously, draw from non-internet sources, such as the nuanced and particular discussions that you and your students are having in class. Oftentimes, ChatGPT-generated writing is recognizable because of its use of repetitive phrases or stylistic constructions, and a lack of specific contexts. Its worth talking with students about what ChatGPT can and cannot do: students are still learning about the affordances and limits of these technologies. So are we. So is everyone. \n",
            "\n",
            "2) AI and Digital Pedagogy\n",
            "\n",
            "When you are inclined to worry that the world of knowledge (and teaching and learning) is coming to an end, think about the use of new AI tools as an extension of already existing digital pedagogical practices. Digital pedagogy can look different depending on the instructor and their discipline: lectures may be paired with online research conducted by students to create a digital artifact. Faculty may use the Designer feature on PowerPoint to make their presentations more visually appealing without a lot of work. Faculty may allow or even encourage students to use Grammarly and other similar tools to check their writing. Faculty may also use such tools themselves. With the abundance of available digital tools faculty can set boundaries and expectations by talking to students about their use of generative AI tools. How do you expect students to use these tools (if at all)? Why? Can you imagine using generative AI tools to support student learning? Many faculty here and elsewhere are addressing these issues in syllabus statements and assignment prompts. As with many technological tools, talk to your students. Dont assume they know whats expected or appropriate. \n",

            "\n",
            "ChatGPT and similar AI tools can increase access to learning resources for students with diverse learning needs. Captioning, audio description, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text are examples of generative AI tools that support inclusive learning. Additionally, students who struggle with writing may benefit from using ChatGPT to help them develop their ideas or improve their writing. Collaboratively writing with ChatGPT, for example, may provide an initial structure for students to strengthen their positions, enhance and specify their arguments, integrate their own voice and perspective,  or edit for clarity. Generative AI may help students reduce stress and spend more time engaging with course content to deepen their learning. Although Generative AI, including ChatGPT, may offer important assists to student learning, it cannot offer personalized support, mentorship, and the relational aspect of teaching and learning, which is fundamental to what we all do at SCU.\n",

The latter includes issues of privacy, racism, and sexism (information is scoured from the internet after all), misinformation, fake citations, and even malicious content. Decades of research on academic integrity (apart from the use of AI) directs us away from an exclusively punitive approach and toward pedagogical practices that acknowledge what academic integrity looks like in our discipline.

Use those articles to find other articles that consider the same question (review the citation list for other articles to read). Either before or after you ask ChatGPT a question, try a google search with the same sort of query and see what it turns up; also, try a search on the OSU library system.

Use those articles to find other articles that consider the same question (review the citation list for other articles to read). Either before or after you ask ChatGPT a question, try a google search with the same sort of query and see what it turns up; also, try a search on the OSU library system.

            "[ this doc is in a different cluster # 2 >> ChatGPT Guidance for Instructors WHAT IS CHATGPT? ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that uses natural language processing techniques to respond to user-generated prompts. While other chatbots are typically limited to pre-programmed responses, ChatGPT can produce original responses in real time. ChatGPT can generate everything from essays and emails to poems and lesson plans. It can revise text with improved grammar and spelling or modulate the style or tone of a provided set of text, as requested by the user. ChatGPT is just one of many generative AI tools. ChatGPT may occasionally incorporate fabricated or incorrect information in its responses. Because of the way it operates, it is difficult to trace the source and provenance of information provided by ChatGPT (except when it is connected to the internet, e.g., Bingintegrated GPT). In addition, because ChatGPT was trained on a corpus of text that was originally written by humans, ChatGPTs responses may reflect the biases present in the text it was trained on. TIPS FOR INSTRUCTORS  Talk to students about your expectations for academic honesty. Many students who engage in academic dishonesty do so impulsively or without significant reflection on the choice. Anticipate this behavior by proactively engaging students in an open discussion about academic honesty in your course, including your expectations regarding ChatGPT. Remind students that they are required to follow UGAs Academic Honesty Policy and talk to your students about how that policy applies to your course. For example, is ChatGPT off-limits, sometimes OK to use, or always encouraged? See below for sample syllabus language related to ChatGPT, or explore the growing repository of classroom policies related to generative AI available here. Use of artificial intelligence or word mixing software to write your paper or disguise plagiarized work is considered unauthorized assistance in this course. Suspected unauthorized assistance, or other violations of UGAs A Culture of Honesty, will be reported to the Office of Academic Honesty. Or:   ChatGPT Guidance      Page 2 We encourage you to use AI tools to explore the field and help you study. However, you must take full responsibility for any AI-generated materials you incorporate in your course products. If you include AI-generated materials in your course products, it should be cited like any other reference material. All information incorporated into course products must be verified, ideas must still be attributed, and facts must be true.  Do not rely solely on AI detector tools (see the Additional Resources section at the end of this document for examples) to identify whether an assignment was created using generative AI. These tools can return false positives and fail to detect some AI-generated material. If you suspect a piece of work was completed using generative AI, carefully analyze the work. If you believe a violation of your course policies may have occurred, instructors should report the incident to the Office of Academic Honesty. A facilitated discussion will be scheduled for you to talk with the student about their process for completing the assignment and whether a violation occurred.  Consider the limitations of ChatGPT when designing course assignments. As of August 1, 2023, ChatGPT (v3.5): o cannot access information that is not already included in its corpus. This includes text or internet resources generated after 2021, notes or other specifics from your course. However, GPT4 and other GPT integrated products do have access to more updated information. o cannot dissect or produce non-text-based responses, although other AIgenerators can produce images and art. o may fabricate references (including contrived DOIs) when prompted to produce citations.  Instructors might deliberately ask students to engage with ChatGPT, or other Generative AI tools, as an educational endeavor. For example, students might analyze how ChatGPT generates text for different audiences, attempt to find the original sources of text used to generate a particular ChatGPT response, compare and contrast ChatGPT output in response to various prompts, or improve upon a given ChatGPT prompt. If you decide to incorporate use of generative AI tools in your course, inform students how/whether you would like them to document or cite their use of generative AI. Discuss with students the importance of transparency and trustworthiness to the process of generating knowledge, the pursuit of a degree, and to the ideals of higher education.   If you ask your students to use ChatGPT, review the privacy policy and provide an opt out. ChatGPT is currently released as a free research preview, meaning that current use of the tool is helping to improve it for future use. OpenAI (the company that designed ChatGPT) collects data from its users which may also be shared with third party entities. If you plan to use ChatGPT in an educational   ChatGPT Guidance      Page 3 setting, it is recommended that you review the privacy policy and terms of use with your students, and provide them with the option to opt out (or alternate means to engage with ChatGPT output) if they do not feel comfortable having their data collected and shared as stated in these policies. \n",

            "Guidelines for Using Generative Artificial Intelligence at the George Washington University April 2023  The Promise of Generative Artificial Intelligence  The wide availability of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools, such as ChatGPT and other large language models, is driving an ongoing conversation about their academic uses.  GAI tools represent an exciting addition to the learning process that can be deployed in innovative ways to advance learning objectives.  This document provides some guidelines for the use of GAI in connection with academic work at the University.  The Office of the Provost encourages the entire University community to embrace these technologies through creative uses and applications.  Faculty are invited to make thoughtful use of GAI tools in their teaching and research.  Used properly, GAI tools can enhance the design of lessons, assignments, and assessments.  Our students will use GAI tools for the rest of their lives.  There are many productive ways in which they might use them as students, consistent with stated course policies and objectives.  Examples include: brainstorming ideas; summarizing and translating content; explaining new concepts to aid comprehension; generating counter-arguments; suggesting titles; debugging code; gathering sources; and formatting references.  Designing Assignments  Even as we are learning ourselves, we must teach our students to use GAI tools effectively and responsibly: to draft appropriate prompts; to think critically about the proper use of the tools and their possible effects on society; to evaluate their outputs with respect to accuracy, bias, and equity.  Exercises might include having students formulate effective prompts; identify superficial rhetoric in GAI-generated content; and evaluate GAI-generated arguments for soundness and  logical validity.  Students could be asked to fact-check, criticize, and/or edit GAI-generated content for credit.  The Instructional Core in the Division of Libraries and Academic Innovation has provided useful guidance for instructors on Responding to Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools.  The Office of the Provost encourages instructors to consult these resources.  Encouraging Responsible Use  For all their promise, GAI tools misused could interfere with learning objectives and impair the development of students writing, analytical, and technical skills.  There are also legitimate concerns about academic ethics, accuracy, citation of sources, and cheating.  The Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities maintains a Faculty Guide to Clarifying Academic Expectations that directly addresses the use of GAI tools in connection with academic work.  An instructor who suspects an academic integrity violation should consider submitting a Charge of Academic Dishonesty.  Note: the Law School and the School of Medicine and Health Sciences maintain their own codes of academic integrity, so the guidance contained in this document does not apply to these schools.  The Office of the Provost encourages instructors to state explicitly and affirmatively their expectations regarding student use of GAI tools.  Instructors should specify in writing the permitted and prohibited uses of GAI tools in their courses.  Instructors might 1) generally permit the use of GAI tools; 2) generally forbid their use; or 3) permit their use for certain purposes on certain assignments, but not others.  If an instructor wishes to permit certain uses of GAI tools, such uses must be set forth explicitly in the course syllabus and/or assignment instructions.  Below is some model language for the three permission options: General Permission Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools such as ChatGPT are becoming important resources in many fields and industries.  Accordingly, you are permitted to use such tools to generate content submitted for evaluation in this course, including [papers; take-home examinations; specified other assignments].  You remain responsible for all content you submit for evaluation. [Instructors might also wish to include language regarding pitfalls, such as the following:] You may use GAI tools to help generate ideas and brainstorm.  However, you should note that the material generated by these tools may be inaccurate, incomplete, or otherwise problematic.  Beware that use may also stifle your own independent thinking and creativity. [Instructors might also wish to include language regarding citation, such as the following:] If you include content (e.g., ideas, text, code, images) that was generated, in whole or in part, by Generative Artificial Intelligence tools (including, but not limited to, ChatGPT and other large language models) in work submitted for evaluation in this course, you must document and credit your source.  For example, text generated using ChatGPT-4 should include a citation such as: ChatGPT-4. (YYYY, Month DD of query). Text of your query. Generated using OpenAI. https://chat.openai.com/. Material generated using other tools should be cited accordingly.  Failure to do so in this course constitutes failure to attribute under the George Washington University Code of Academic Integrity. General Prohibition By submitting work for evaluation in this course, you represent it as your own intellectual product.  You may not submit for evaluation any content (e.g., ideas, text, code, images) that was generated, in whole or in part, by Generative Artificial Intelligence tools (including, but not limited to, ChatGPT and other large language models).  Doing so in this course constitutes cheating under the George Washington University Code of Academic Integrity. [Instructors might also wish to include language regarding papers about AI:] Although this course generally prohibits use of GAI tools, the instructor may choose to grant an exception if you propose to write a paper about [some aspect of artificial intelligence].  Such an exception must be granted in writing (e.g., email) to avoid the danger of misunderstanding. Selective Permission By submitting work for evaluation in this course, you represent it as your own intellectual product.  You may not submit for evaluation any content (e.g., ideas, text, code, images) that was generated, in whole or in part, by Generative Artificial Intelligence tools (including, but not limited to, ChatGPT and other large language models) unless the instructor has explicitly granted permission to do so.  Your instructor will explain to you the uses of GAI tools that are permitted or prohibited in this course, including on what specific assignments use of GAI tools is permitted.  Submitting content for evaluation that was produced in whole or in part by GAI tools, except for the specific purpose(s) and assignment(s) discussed and authorized by the instructor, constitutes cheating in this course under the George Washington University Code of Academic Integrity. [Instructors choosing the Selective Permission option might also wish to include some or all of the additional potential language from the General Permission and General Prohibition options, above.]   Default Rules  In the absence of explicit directions to the contrary from instructors, the following default rules apply at the University.  1. Work submitted for evaluation is represented as the students own intellectual product.  Students may not submit content (e.g., ideas, text, code, images) for evaluation that was generated, in whole or in part, by Generative Artificial Intelligence tools (such as ChatGPT and other large language models).  Doing so without instructors explicit permission constitutes cheating under the Code of Academic Integrity and is therefore prohibited.  Examples (illustrative only) of conduct that is prohibited unless explicitly permitted by the instructor:  A student types a prompt into a GAI tool and pastes all or part of the generated content into their answer on an out-of-class assessment or test.  A student types a prompt into a GAI tool and incorporates all or part of the generated content into an essay submitted for evaluation, without proper attribution to the GAI tool.  2. Students are permitted to use GAI tools to generate content that is not submitted to an instructor for evaluation.  For example, using GAI tools to study for examinations, tests, and quizzes is permitted.  Likewise, on assignments where the use of the Internet is not otherwise prohibited by the instructor, GAI tools may be used for learning, studying, and brainstorming.  Examples (illustrative only) of permitted conduct:  A student types a prompt into a GAI tool and reviews the generated content to help them study for a test.  A student types a prompt into a GAI tool and uses the generated content to help them brainstorm ideas for a term paper or research project.  3. Unless the instructor explicitly states otherwise in advance and in writing, the use of GAI tools during any assessment (e.g., examination, test, quiz) whether taken in the classroom or elsewhere, constitutes cheating under the Code of Academic Integrity and is therefore prohibited.  This prohibition includes assessments for which the use of the Internet is otherwise permitted.  Examples (illustrative only) of conduct that is prohibited unless explicitly permitted by the instructor:  While taking an out-of-class (take-home) test on which Internet use is generally permitted, a student types a prompt into a GAI tool and incorporates some or all of the generated content into their submitted answer.  While taking an in-class quiz on which Internet use is generally permitted, a student types a prompt into a GAI tool and incorporates some of the ideas generated into their submitted answer.  Before taking an in-class quiz on which Internet use is generally permitted, a student types a prompt into a GAI tool, saves the generated content to a document, and pastes some or all of the text into their submitted answer while taking the quiz.  Final Thoughts  As we enter this new technological era, the Office of the Provost encourages instructors to confer with the Instructional Core if they have questions about best practices for course design, pedagogy, assessment, and with the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities for questions about academic integrity.  Further, we appreciate that this technology is evolving, and we will update this guidance as circumstances require. \n",

Use those articles to find other articles that consider the same question (review the citation list for other articles to read). Either before or after you ask ChatGPT a question, try a google search with the same sort of query and see what it turns up; also, try a search on the OSU library system.

            "AI has many possible uses to improve and expand students learning experience. However, students will need clear guidelines for when it is appropriate to use and how to use AI in the course. Adding guiding statements to each assignment and assessment description is one of the best ways to reinforce your position on student use of these tools to complete their assignments. Personal or reflective assignments are less susceptible to Large Language Models and chatbots. You might also consider asking students to connect course materials to their own life and experience, or document the relevance to their personal learning goals. \n",

If your course includes generative content, such as typed assignments, code, or visual/musical media, you will want to emphasize how students should reference their usage of AI resources. Students will benefit from knowing that AI resources such as ChatGPT pull information and data from across the internet, which can lead to factual inaccuracies and implicit biases. If your course learning outcomes require individual student output that AI tools can mimic, you will want to make explicit whether you expect students to refrain from using these tools. Finally, if you have strong feelings about AI tools and the drawbacks of their use, discuss those issues in class with students. Share your perspectives on how you think these tools can help or hinder their learning, and why you value academic integrity. We suggest focusing on the benefit to students and their learning, and not potential negative consequences to their grade.   \n",

            "STATEMENT OF POLICY AND PROCEDURE\n",
            "A. BACKGROUND\n",
            "The following points are background for these policy:\n",
            "\n",
            "1) VALUE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION.\n",
            "Artificial Intelligence Tools are, and will increasingly be, a vital component of many academic and professional disciplines. Academic units have integrated Artificial Intelligence tools into their courses and curricula, and the University as a whole recognizes the enormous pedagogical value of these tools.\n",
            "\n",
            "2) RAPIDLY CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS.\n",
            "The landscape of Artificial Intelligence Tools is rapidly changing, including the names of the most commonly used tools, the wide variety of contexts and uses in which the tools are employed, and the scope and efficacy of these tools. Consequently, no attempt is made to catalog or taxonomize this landscape. Rather, Appendix A AI Tools: Scope and Use at Drexel University presents a partial snapshot of the current landscape, with the recognition this snapshot will require regular updates to maintain relevance.\n",
            "\n",
            "3) PRIMACY OF INSTRUCTOR PREFERENCE ON SUITABLE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TOOLS IN COURSEWORK.\n",
            "The broad scope of the University's education and learning enterprise, including breadth of topic, level, pedagogy, and mode, as well as the broad scope of use of Artificial Intelligence Tools in education and learning naturally lead to a broad scope for the suitable use of these tools in the classroom. Consequently, a foundational component of this policy is that instructors have broad discretion to define the suitable use of Artificial Intelligence Tools in the classroom.\n",
            "\n",
            "B. POLICY ON FACULTY RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR USE OF AI.\n",
            "1) RIGHT OF INSTRUCTOR TO SPECIFY PERMITTED USE OF AI.\n",
            "It is the right of the course instructor to decide whether AI Tools are to be permitted in the course and, if they are allowed, to describe precisely the conditions and criteria for use. Certain limited exceptions may apply for students with disabilities consistent with ODR-1 and applicable law. Students requesting or requiring accommodations are encouraged to contact the Office of Disability Resources.\n",
            "\n",
            "2) RESPONSIBILITY OF INSTRUCTOR TO COMMUNICATE PERMITTED USE OF AI.\n",
            "It is the responsibility of the instructor to include in the course syllabus a clearly written description of the permitted use of AI tools. It is strongly recommended that the instructor discuss this written description at the beginning of the course and as needed throughout the term. It is also expected that faculty describe precisely how students are expected to attribute / cite the use of AI tools. To assist faculty with communicating which AI tools are permitted in a course, Appendix A (AI Tools: Scope and Use at Drexel University) provides a checklist of common AI tools that faculty can customize based on their preference and include in the syllabus, and Appendix C (AI Tools: Sample Syllabi Language) provides language instructors may use in their syllabus to summarize their course policy on the use of AI.\n",
            "\n",
            "3) DEFAULT POLICIES ON COURSE-RELATED USE OF AI.\n",
            "Given the wide and dynamic landscape of AI Tools available for use by students in coursework, it is NOT required for the instructor to specify permitted use of every such tool. Instead, wherever there is a lack of clarity or specification, the default policy on the use of AI Tools in courses is that such tools are not permitted. Below are three important exceptions to this statement:\n",
            "\n",
            "a. All databases and research tools provided by Drexel University Libraries are approved for use in coursework, unless such usage contradicts instructor guidance on coursework completion.\n",
            "\n",
            "b. Appendix A (AI Tools: Scope and Use at Drexel University) includes a list of AI tools that are approved for use in coursework by default, unless such usage contradicts instructor guidance on coursework completion.\n",
            "\n",
            "c. Certain exceptions will apply for students with disabilities. Students requesting or requiring accommodations are encouraged to contact the Office of Disability Resources.\n",
            "\n",
            "C. POLICY ON STUDENT RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES FOR USE OF AI.\n",
            "1) RESPONSIBILITY OF STUDENT TO ADHERE TO INSTRUCTOR SPECIFIED USE OF AI.\n",
            "It is the responsibility of the student to read, understand, and seek clarification from the instructor where necessary on the instructor's written and verbal descriptions of the acceptable use of AI in the course. If usage of AI Tool(s) is permitted by the instructor, students are obligated to follow the instructor's guidance regarding the nature of that usage.\n",
            "\n",
            "2) RESPONSIBILITY OF STUDENT TO CITE USAGE OF AI.\n",
            "If usage of AI Tool(s) is permitted by the instructor, students are obligated to follow the instructor's guidance regarding if and how that usage is to be attributed/cited in the submitted work. If no attribution / citation guidance is given by the instructor, the students should adopt the style typically used in the discipline most closely aligned with the course. Appendix B (AI Tools: Citation of Use at Drexel University) aims to assist students with the various citation rules and styles for AI and AI Tools.\n",
            "\n",
            "3) RESPONSIBILITY OF STUDENT FOR SUBMITTED WORK GENERATED BY AI.\n",
            "If usage of AI Tool(s) is permitted by the instructor, the final work product that is submitted is nonetheless the responsibility of the student. It is important that students are aware that AI generated content may be false or biased, and students assume ownership of and responsibility for submitted work that may be violative of other university policies. Inappropriate or offensive content may be reported to Student Conduct & Care or other relevant university offices for consideration of appropriate next steps, if any.\n",
            "\n",
            "D. USE AND MISUSE OF AI DETECTION TOOLS.\n",
            "The purpose of this section is to clarify the use and potential misuse of so-called AI Detection Tools. These tools aim to assess whether or not AI or an AI Tool has been used to create a digital object (e.g., text, audio, image, video); in this context this applies to any and all student submitted work. There is no restriction on the use of such tools by the instructor, but the instructor is urged to be aware of the potential misuse or misinterpretation of the outputs presented by these tools.\n",
            "\n",
            "1) FALLIBILITY OF AI DETECTION TOOLS.\n",
            "Such tools are often fallible; they may both assert the digital object was created by AI when it was not or assert the digital object was not created by AI when it was. Such tools often advertise error rates to describe the frequency or likelihood of these mistakes.\n",
            "\n",
            "a. Users of AI Detection Tools should be aware that the method used by these tools to determine if AI was used is particularly likely to yield false positives in the cases of neurodivergent students and students for whom English is not their first language.\n",
            "\n",
            "b. Recent research also indicates that AI Detection Tools yield false negatives where students use paraphrasing tools or edit the document after using AI.\n",
            "\n",
            "2) MISESTIMATION OF FALLIBILITY OF AI DETECTION TOOLS.\n",
            "The creators and distributors of such tools may misestimate the fallibility of the tool. Instructors are advised to exercise caution regarding the asserted level of accuracy.\n",
            "\n",
            "3) ABSENCE OF PROOF FOR AI DETECTION TOOLS.\n",
            "In the context of plagiarism, for which the same or similar tools are often used, the tool is often able to provide proof to accompany an assertion of plagiarism in the form of demonstrating similarity between the object being assessed (i.e., the work submitted by a student) and another object (i.e., the reference work from which the student's submission was taken or adapted). In contrast, it is often the case that no such proof is available from AI Detection Tools.\n",
            "\n",
            "4) GUIDANCE ON THE USE OF AI DETECTION TOOLS.\n",
            "Due to the possible fallibility, possible misestimation of fallibility, and possible absence of proof to accompany assertions of AI use by AI Detection Tools, it is recommended that instructors use such tools with great caution and with full recognition of their limitations. In general, the evidence provided by such tools should be only part of an instructors case when accusing a student of academic misconduct.\n",
            "\n",
            "E. STUDENT CONDUCT PROCESS FOR PERCEIVED VIOLATION OF USE OF AI.\n",
            "1) APPLICABILITY OF THE STUDENT CONDUCT PROCESS.\n",
            "The scope of applicability of the Academic Integrity Conduct Process is in no way limited by this policy.\n",
            "The Board on Conduct Affairs (BCA) has been asked to address the Honor Code implications of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT, Bard, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion. These are novel tools, and both students and instructors have been experimenting with their use in academic settings.  \n",
            "\n",
            "While these tools have applications that foster student learning and understanding, these tools can also be used in ways that bypass key learning objectives.\n",
            "\n",
            "To give sufficient space for instructors to explore uses of generative AI tools in their courses, and to set clear guidelines to students about what uses are and are not consistent with the Stanford Honor Code, the BCA has set forth the following policy guidance regarding generative AI in the context of coursework:\n",
            "\n",
            "Absent a clear statement from a course instructor, use of or consultation with generative AI shall be treated analogously to assistance from another person. In particular, using generative AI tools to substantially complete an assignment or exam (e.g. by entering exam or assignment questions) is not permitted. Students should acknowledge the use of generative AI (other than incidental use) and default to disclosing such assistance when in doubt.\n",
            "\n",
            "Individual course instructors are free to set their own policies regulating the use of generative AI tools in their courses, including allowing or disallowing some or all uses of such tools. Course instructors should set such policies in their course syllabi and clearly communicate such policies to students. Students who are unsure of policies regarding generative AI tools are encouraged to ask their instructors for clarification.\n",
            "\n",
            "The BCA will continue to monitor developments in these tools and their use in academic settings and may update this guidance. Members of the community are encouraged to contact the BCA to provide input, suggestions, and comments on this policy.\n",

For example, have students generate an AI response to a prompt, then critique and fact check the product. What questions can the tool answer adequately? What are its limitations? In what aspects is the response flat-out wrong? Another option is to have students develop successive drafts of a piece with ChatGPT, documenting how they refined prompts for each draft and reflecting on the strengths or limitations of the prompt in light of the output.

Please use this form to contribute to Educator Insights: AI for Learning! An Insiders Guide to Learning with AI What AI Can and Cant Do for You as a Learner It takes a lot of work to get into college, and its also a significant financial investment. How can you get the most out of the experience? The truth is, the more effort you put into your learning, the more you gain: skills and strengths that serve you well both now and in the future. But this wont happen if you lean on AI to do your work for you.  Northeastern is all about experiential learning, learning by doing, with you in charge of making connections and charting a special path. In contrast, AI-generated work is generic, even to the point of being boring. Its also sometimes flat-out wrong! AI doesnt know about your unique life experiences, thoughts, and goals. When you invest yourself into your work, the products are unique and irreplaceable. It also is true that AI is becoming integral to many aspects of our lives. In the near future most jobs will involve some form of AI, and generative AI tools can be extremely useful when used appropriately. Learning how to work with AI wisely and creatively  becoming AI literate  can position you for success in high demand jobs of the future. So there is a legitimate place for AI in learning, but you need to be actively involved to gain the benefit.  As you consider whether to use generative AI in your classes or while on co-op, keep the following 5 tips in mind. AI @ Northeastern: Top 5 Tips 1. Talk with your instructor: Expectations for AI will vary across disciplines and courses, so its important to read the syllabus and check with your instructor to find out whats allowed. If youre not sure whats allowed, be sure to ask before using it. 2. When using AI, stay in the drivers seat: Let AI challenge and aid you, but never let it take over. AI outputs can be inaccurate, incomplete, or even biased. It should never be used as the sole source. Consider also the strengths and limitations of what the tool puts out. Critique what it produces. Refine your prompts to get a result thats more accurate and closer to what you need. Remember that its important to make the product your own, because originality matters. This will almost always involve a lot of revising and refining on your part. 3. Remember that the process of learning is as important as the product: Keep track of how you go about your work, for example prompts and iterations of AI output and how you use or modify what you generate. This will help you explain what youve created to others and cite your use of AI properly. Some instructors will even require that you submit this documentation along with the completed assignment. Be prepared to speak to your learning process. 4. Learning is a human endeavor: Dont be afraid to ask your instructor or TA for feedback on worksin-progress and get feedback from peers if that is also allowed. Its not just you and the computer on your own! 5. Cite AI Properly: Always cite AI if you use it in assignments. For example: In response to the question Why is feedback important?, ChatGPT suggested \"feedback acts as a compass in learning...\" (OpenAI, 2023). The APA and MLA provide style guides for citing Generative AI. \n",

            "You may be hearing an array of opinions about the implications that generative AI (Gen AI) tools might have for the future of teaching and learning. Any time a new technology like Gen AI emerges and captures the publics attention, initial reactions tend to be polarized. Some see AI as a threat to higher education, while others view it as a positive force for reshaping the way we teach.\n",

            "\n",
            "What is generative AI?\n",
            "Generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) describes several types of AI that are capable of creating new text, images, code, audio, or other types of content. Tools such as ChatGPT have been trained using very large collections of existing media to generate human-like responses to user-authored prompts. For text-based content, these large language models can be used to answer questions, write essays or articles, create lesson plans, and much more. The content creation process is limited by the tools training media and the user prompt.\n",

            "Gen AI tools are becoming increasingly influential across many industries, making it essential for students to learn how to utilize these tools within their specific fields of study. However, the potential for misuse of Gen AI also raises concerns for evaluating student learning. Interrogating the risks and opportunities of these tools in different types of courses and disciplines (course size, delivery modality, topic, etc.) is key to finding ways to leverage their power while limiting their abuse. \n",

            "The Office of Undergraduate Academic Integrity offers the following guidance: While most students largely engage in honest behavior in the classroom, some may choose to use tools such as ChatGPT to engage in academic dishonesty. Please continue to be clear in your expectations with your student related to the Undergraduate Honor Code and the use of AI software just as you would other websites that may provide students with means to engage in academic dishonesty. The unauthorized use of ChatGPT and other AI software may fall under several definitions of academic dishonesty in the Undergraduate Honor Code. If you believe that a student has engaged in academic dishonesty, please contact the Office of Undergraduate Academic Integrity at 540-231-9876 or email the office at honorsys@vt.edu to discuss what occurred.\n",
            "The Graduate Honor System reviews each case in its own context. Faculty are encouraged to provide clear and precise guidance about when or if the use of tools such as ChatGPT are allowed, encouraged, or prohibited and candidly discuss with students the learning value of completing an assignment with or without such tools. GHS decisions about any potential violation will be based on what guidance faculty provided. If you believe that a graduate student may have committed an academic integrity violation, please refer the case to the Graduate Honor System; 540-231-9564; ghs@vt.edu.\n",
            "3. Avoid being drawn into a confrontational mindset regarding these tools.\n",
            "Given the obvious implications for academic integrity, tools are being developed and promoted that may provide some perspective on whether or not student submissions were written by AI. Due to the evolving nature of AI solutions, these tools are never going to be 100% accurate, and an overreliance on a tool to catch anyone using AI is likely to lead to a slippery slope of ineffective and highly stressful interactions with students.\n",
            "4. Set clear expectations for your students regarding the use of generative AI/ChatGPT.\n",
            "Directly address the reasoning behind any restrictions you decide to implement.\n",
            "Consider updating course documentation about academic integrity to include a statement specifically addressing the use of generative AI/ChatGPT (see ideas below).\n",
            "5. Explore potential changes to your course design and/or assessment strategies.\n",
            "Consider incorporating course assessment practices aligned with principles of authentic assessment such as seeking to replicate professional experiences, expecting a task-focused demonstration of understanding, and providing opportunities for practice with feedback. (See Teaching Resources - Assessing Student Learning - Authentic Assessment from Indiana University for some more detailed ideas.)\n",
            "Consider allowing multiple options for action and expression in your assessments. This is a principle of Universal Design for Learning that suggests students be allowed to select from various methods and technology tools to showcase their understanding and support their learning.\n",

Develop and integrate a generative AI policy throughout the course resources:  Provide clear definitions, expectations, and repercussions of what will happen if students violate the policy.  Explain the standards of academic integrity in the course, especially as related to use of AI technologies, and review the Integrity of Scholarship and Grades Policy.  Be clear about what types of AI are acceptable and what versions of the technology students can use or not use.  Put this policy into D2L and any assignment instructions consistently. 3. Discuss these expectations when talking about course policies at the beginning of the course and remind students about them as you discuss course assignments:  Take time to explain to students the pros and cons of generative AI technologies relative to your course.  Explain the development of your policy and make clear the values, ethics, and philosophies underpinning its development.  Explain the repercussions of not following the course policy and submit an Academic Dishonesty Report if needed. 4. If you want to integrate AI in the classroom as an allowed or required resource:  Consult with MSU IT guidance about recommendations for use and adoption of generative AI technology, including guidelines for keeping you and your data safe.  Determine if MSU already has access to the tools you desire for free, and if not available through MSU, consider the cost and availability of the resources you will allow or require, and go through MSU's procurement process.  If you want to require students to use an AI technology that comes with a cost, put the resource into the scheduling system as you would a textbook, so students know that is an anticipated cost to them. Promote Equitable and Inclusive Use 1. Consider equity and inclusion when making decisions about AI use in your course. 1.1. How does the development and use of generative AI affect identity groups differentially? What biases exist within the development and use of generative AI? What are the potential challenges regarding AI from an equity-lens (e.g., historic issues with facial recognition and BIPOC populations)?  1.2. What data sources does generative AI use to generate a response, and how representative is this data source? 2. Consider how AI content and perspectives can enhance dialogue and collaboration between diverse disciplines, departments, and individuals. 3. Consider how integration of generative AI technologies into the classroom help or hinder students success. 4. Consider situations in which some students may have access to more advanced technology than others based on cost or other factors. 5. Consider if generative AI technology provides accommodation for certain populations and how its use may help achieve equity for persons with disabilities. Determine Ethical and Scholarly Use The determination of appropriate uses for generative AI can be facilitated through discussion with colleagues within and among disciplines. Discussions that can help our communities to answer 1. What is the ethical use of AI in society, in a given scholarly discipline, and in instruction? 2. How does generative AI pose ethical challenges to issues such as data security and privacy? 3. What types of information should and should not be inputted into an AI system? 4. When does generative AI-assistance become AI-ownership? What are the limits to using generative AI in support of academic work? 5. How should a student cite or disclose the use of generative AI relative to their academic work? 6. How does the course/instructor define plagiarism and academic dishonesty relate to AI? What are the penalties for not following the policy? Many philosophies and policies outlined on the OSSA Academic Integrity website already apply, and additional specific guidance is available on FAQs specifically addressing generative AI. AI as a complex issue requiring multiple perspectives and dialogue 1. How can generative AI technologies assist with collaborative, integrated, and interdisciplinary work in the classroom? 2. What is the appropriate use of generative AI in the subject-area and/or discipline to advance scholarship and maintain excellence? 3. What are the current uses, concerns, and dialogue relative to generative AI within the subject and/or discipline? 4. How will generative AI affect the unit/major/courses content, assignments, instructional objectives, learning outcomes, or assessment models? Might these outcomes need to change to account for AI technology? 5. How will generative AI influence job growth, skills, and responsibilities in the future? To help facilitate this work, the Center for Teaching and Learning Innovation (CTLI) and the Enhanced Digital Learning Initiative (EDLI) will be producing resources, offering workshops, and facilitating discussions throughout the year. You can learn more about generative AI and participate in discussions in the AI & Education group on iteach.msu.edu. \n",
            "As the availability of generative AI grows and the quality of these tools improves, student and faculty perspectives on the use of generative AI become more diversewith some expressing academic integrity concerns and others advocating for thoughtful ways to incorporate these tools into learning. The Whiting School of Engineering (WSE) recommends communicating with students about their perspectives and the various approaches that can be taken when using these tools in higher education. By engaging in these discussions, collectively, we can learn more about diverse perspectives and better understand the benefits and drawbacks of generative AI, whether it is permissible to use in your courses, and how these tools support or hinder learning and achievement of course objectives.\n",

            "It is important to remember that chatGPT and other AI tools are not a replacement for your own critical thinking and original ideas. The ultimate goal of this course and any tool used to submit work is to enhance your own learning and understanding, not to undermine it.\n",
            "As a college student, it is your responsibility to maintain the highest standards of academic integrity. Representing work generated by artificial intelligence as one's own work is considered to be academically dishonest. This includes (a) ensuring that all work submitted for grades is your own original work, and (b) properly citing any sources that you use.\n",
            "Having AI write your paper constitutes plagiarism. If the source of the work is unclear, I may require you to meet with me to explain the ideas and your writing process.\n",
            "If you consult with other students or use any sources on an assignment, report this in the work that you turn in. Do not generate new content with prompt-based AI tools like ChatGPT or CodePilot without permission from instructors unless specifically allowed by the assignment. (Using, for example, Grammarly as a language aid is OK.) Instructors reserve the right to request an oral explanation of answers.\n",

            "5. Regarding AI detection tools:\n",
            "A. While there are emerging tools designed to detect AI-produced content (including Hugging Face, GPTZero, CrossPlag, and Turnitin), we recommend against relying on them for several reasons:\n",
            "These tools are not perfect.\n",
            "Their false positives may cause faculty to falsely identify a students own work as being AI-generated. Chasing down these false leads can waste time and inspire unnecessary mistrust between faculty and students.\n",
            "Their false negatives may cause faculty to falsely ascribe an AIs work to the student.\n",
            "B. These tools are generally only effective when the entire piece was produced by AI, but if the student has included some AI-generated work interspersed within their own words, it is much harder for these tools to detect.\n",
            "C. Students are already coming up with ways to beat AI-detection tools: one prominent approach is to ask one AI-generating tool (e.g., chatGPT) to create the first draft of an assignment, and then to ask another AI-generating tool (e.g., CopyGenius and Quillbot AI) to rephrase each paragraph, making it much harder to detect.\n",
            "D. AI-generating tools will evolve to evade AI-detecting tools, and then AI-detecting tools will evolve to get better at identifying AI-generated work. The arms race to detect AI-generated work and the time faculty spent staying current on the best AI-detection tools may have a higher cost than the benefit these tools provide.\n",
            "E. Some AI-generated tools, such as chatGPT, may develop watermarks that allow the text they generate to be easily identified, but as AI-generating tools proliferate, some students will migrate to tools that dont include these watermarks when they feel incentivized to do so.\n",
            "\n",
            "In sum, tools that claim to detect AI-generated work are easy for students to work around if they want to, and it can be easy for faculty to invest large amounts of time into policing their students instead of investing time into fostering student learning. Rather than relying on AI-detection software, we recommend designing assignments that foster student learning that cannot be replicated by AI-tools (such as in-class writing; peer review; small, frequent, personal essays; essays that cite scholarship in the field or classroom discussions; projects that involve interviews or original data original; essays that cite current events; assigning multi-modal assignments, podcasts, explainer videos, or any of the other principles outlined above.)\n",
            " \n",
            "In addition, some faculty may also want to use chatGPT in their course. For example, one can imagine that students can use chatGPT to apply concepts from class to generate initial ideas for papers or research projects, or to analyze and refine early drafts. Moreover, incorporating AI tools into ones course can also provide training and practice for students entering professional environments where the use of AI will be a relevant skill.\n",

            "[ this doc is in a different cluster # 1 >> ChatGPT Guidance for Instructors WHAT IS CHATGPT? ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that uses natural language processing techniques to respond to user-generated prompts. While other chatbots are typically limited to pre-programmed responses, ChatGPT can produce original responses in real time. ChatGPT can generate everything from essays and emails to poems and lesson plans. It can revise text with improved grammar and spelling or modulate the style or tone of a provided set of text, as requested by the user. ChatGPT is just one of many generative AI tools. ChatGPT may occasionally incorporate fabricated or incorrect information in its responses. Because of the way it operates, it is difficult to trace the source and provenance of information provided by ChatGPT (except when it is connected to the internet, e.g., Bingintegrated GPT). In addition, because ChatGPT was trained on a corpus of text that was originally written by humans, ChatGPTs responses may reflect the biases present in the text it was trained on. TIPS FOR INSTRUCTORS  Talk to students about your expectations for academic honesty. Many students who engage in academic dishonesty do so impulsively or without significant reflection on the choice. Anticipate this behavior by proactively engaging students in an open discussion about academic honesty in your course, including your expectations regarding ChatGPT. Remind students that they are required to follow UGAs Academic Honesty Policy and talk to your students about how that policy applies to your course. For example, is ChatGPT off-limits, sometimes OK to use, or always encouraged? See below for sample syllabus language related to ChatGPT, or explore the growing repository of classroom policies related to generative AI available here. Use of artificial intelligence or word mixing software to write your paper or disguise plagiarized work is considered unauthorized assistance in this course. Suspected unauthorized assistance, or other violations of UGAs A Culture of Honesty, will be reported to the Office of Academic Honesty. Or:   ChatGPT Guidance      Page 2 We encourage you to use AI tools to explore the field and help you study. However, you must take full responsibility for any AI-generated materials you incorporate in your course products. If you include AI-generated materials in your course products, it should be cited like any other reference material. All information incorporated into course products must be verified, ideas must still be attributed, and facts must be true.  Do not rely solely on AI detector tools (see the Additional Resources section at the end of this document for examples) to identify whether an assignment was created using generative AI. These tools can return false positives and fail to detect some AI-generated material. If you suspect a piece of work was completed using generative AI, carefully analyze the work. If you believe a violation of your course policies may have occurred, instructors should report the incident to the Office of Academic Honesty. A facilitated discussion will be scheduled for you to talk with the student about their process for completing the assignment and whether a violation occurred.  Consider the limitations of ChatGPT when designing course assignments. As of August 1, 2023, ChatGPT (v3.5): o cannot access information that is not already included in its corpus. This includes text or internet resources generated after 2021, notes or other specifics from your course. However, GPT4 and other GPT integrated products do have access to more updated information. o cannot dissect or produce non-text-based responses, although other AIgenerators can produce images and art. o may fabricate references (including contrived DOIs) when prompted to produce citations.  Instructors might deliberately ask students to engage with ChatGPT, or other Generative AI tools, as an educational endeavor. For example, students might analyze how ChatGPT generates text for different audiences, attempt to find the original sources of text used to generate a particular ChatGPT response, compare and contrast ChatGPT output in response to various prompts, or improve upon a given ChatGPT prompt. If you decide to incorporate use of generative AI tools in your course, inform students how/whether you would like them to document or cite their use of generative AI. Discuss with students the importance of transparency and trustworthiness to the process of generating knowledge, the pursuit of a degree, and to the ideals of higher education.   If you ask your students to use ChatGPT, review the privacy policy and provide an opt out. ChatGPT is currently released as a free research preview, meaning that current use of the tool is helping to improve it for future use. OpenAI (the company that designed ChatGPT) collects data from its users which may also be shared with third party entities. If you plan to use ChatGPT in an educational   ChatGPT Guidance      Page 3 setting, it is recommended that you review the privacy policy and terms of use with your students, and provide them with the option to opt out (or alternate means to engage with ChatGPT output) if they do not feel comfortable having their data collected and shared as stated in these policies. \n",

            "\n",
            "For those of you who are unfamiliar, Chat GPT3 is a Large Language Model tool developed by OpenAI. The tool was released in November 2022, is powered by large amounts of data (~175 billion parameters), and relies on deep neural networks to predict and generate text in response to user prompts. There is much debate about the quality of the text generated but there is both interest and concern related to AI-generated text.  Based on conversations to date, our faculty are simultaneously interested in learning how ChatGPT3 and similar chat bots might transform teaching, learning, and assessment in innovative ways, and concerned about students use of Chat GPT3 to answer test and exam questions and generate content for written papers and assignments. Below, we lay out a number of recommendations for our faculty.\n",

            "Faculty members might take time to experiment with ChatGPT[1] for themselves and discover the capabilities and limitations for their particular discipline and context. One way to become more familiar with ChatGPT is to submit your own writing prompts or assignment questions and examine the type and quality of text generated. Making multiple attempts can illuminate the range of text generated to the same prompt. In addition, dont be surprised if you get a message ChatGPT is at capacity right now.\n",
            "Faculty are encouraged to engage their colleagues and students in conversation about ChatGPT. This will help us to crowdsource both pedagogical opportunities and assessment concerns.  Some faculty plan to have students use ChatGPT to generate essays and then have students critique and improve those essays[2]. Other faculty are busy revisiting their assessment strategy and assignment particulars. Still others told us they plan to ask students to provide writing samples at the beginning of the semester.  Another indicated they planned to replace some writing assignments with oral presentations with Q&A, or contingently reserve the right to do so. \n",
            "Faculty are encouraged to amend their syllabus[3] to add a statement that explicitly addresses student use of ChatGPT or similar tools use that is consistent with their teaching and learning philosophy. Faculty should be transparent about what students are permitted to use and under what conditions. Faculty might consider requiring students to include brief acknowledgement statements with assignments, ones in which they share (and perhaps reflect on) which tools they used in the process of completing their work. Two divergent examples are provided below and additional samples will be accessible on the CETL syllabus template.\n",
            "Every faculty member should take advantage of this opportunity to reflect on their course and lesson learning outcomes and (re)consider the extent to which their assessment strategy is aligned to measure those learning outcomes, and to identify adjustments needed for existing assessments and opportunities for creating alternative authentic assessments.\n",
            "We believe maintaining a balanced and realistic perspective of the impacts of AI is more productive and appropriate than a narrow focus on surveillance and detection. While we believe that the vast majority of Uconn students are committed to the highest ideals of academic integrity, we also know that some students may be tempted to use ChatGPT3 and other tools in ways not permitted. For this reason, we wanted to let you know that the University administration is exploring various AI detection software that faculty could use to identify possible AI generated content. Until then, faculty may choose to use open source experimental detection applications such as GPTZero and AI Content Detector, being mindful that interpretation of results should be tempered by the fact that neither provide definitive evidence.\n",

            "[ this doc is in a different cluster # 1 >> ChatGPT Guidance for Instructors WHAT IS CHATGPT? ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that uses natural language processing techniques to respond to user-generated prompts. While other chatbots are typically limited to pre-programmed responses, ChatGPT can produce original responses in real time. ChatGPT can generate everything from essays and emails to poems and lesson plans. It can revise text with improved grammar and spelling or modulate the style or tone of a provided set of text, as requested by the user. ChatGPT is just one of many generative AI tools. ChatGPT may occasionally incorporate fabricated or incorrect information in its responses. Because of the way it operates, it is difficult to trace the source and provenance of information provided by ChatGPT (except when it is connected to the internet, e.g., Bingintegrated GPT). In addition, because ChatGPT was trained on a corpus of text that was originally written by humans, ChatGPTs responses may reflect the biases present in the text it was trained on. TIPS FOR INSTRUCTORS  Talk to students about your expectations for academic honesty. Many students who engage in academic dishonesty do so impulsively or without significant reflection on the choice. Anticipate this behavior by proactively engaging students in an open discussion about academic honesty in your course, including your expectations regarding ChatGPT. Remind students that they are required to follow UGAs Academic Honesty Policy and talk to your students about how that policy applies to your course. For example, is ChatGPT off-limits, sometimes OK to use, or always encouraged? See below for sample syllabus language related to ChatGPT, or explore the growing repository of classroom policies related to generative AI available here. Use of artificial intelligence or word mixing software to write your paper or disguise plagiarized work is considered unauthorized assistance in this course. Suspected unauthorized assistance, or other violations of UGAs A Culture of Honesty, will be reported to the Office of Academic Honesty. Or:   ChatGPT Guidance      Page 2 We encourage you to use AI tools to explore the field and help you study. However, you must take full responsibility for any AI-generated materials you incorporate in your course products. If you include AI-generated materials in your course products, it should be cited like any other reference material. All information incorporated into course products must be verified, ideas must still be attributed, and facts must be true.  Do not rely solely on AI detector tools (see the Additional Resources section at the end of this document for examples) to identify whether an assignment was created using generative AI. These tools can return false positives and fail to detect some AI-generated material. If you suspect a piece of work was completed using generative AI, carefully analyze the work. If you believe a violation of your course policies may have occurred, instructors should report the incident to the Office of Academic Honesty. A facilitated discussion will be scheduled for you to talk with the student about their process for completing the assignment and whether a violation occurred.  Consider the limitations of ChatGPT when designing course assignments. As of August 1, 2023, ChatGPT (v3.5): o cannot access information that is not already included in its corpus. This includes text or internet resources generated after 2021, notes or other specifics from your course. However, GPT4 and other GPT integrated products do have access to more updated information. o cannot dissect or produce non-text-based responses, although other AIgenerators can produce images and art. o may fabricate references (including contrived DOIs) when prompted to produce citations.  Instructors might deliberately ask students to engage with ChatGPT, or other Generative AI tools, as an educational endeavor. For example, students might analyze how ChatGPT generates text for different audiences, attempt to find the original sources of text used to generate a particular ChatGPT response, compare and contrast ChatGPT output in response to various prompts, or improve upon a given ChatGPT prompt. If you decide to incorporate use of generative AI tools in your course, inform students how/whether you would like them to document or cite their use of generative AI. Discuss with students the importance of transparency and trustworthiness to the process of generating knowledge, the pursuit of a degree, and to the ideals of higher education.   If you ask your students to use ChatGPT, review the privacy policy and provide an opt out. ChatGPT is currently released as a free research preview, meaning that current use of the tool is helping to improve it for future use. OpenAI (the company that designed ChatGPT) collects data from its users which may also be shared with third party entities. If you plan to use ChatGPT in an educational   ChatGPT Guidance      Page 3 setting, it is recommended that you review the privacy policy and terms of use with your students, and provide them with the option to opt out (or alternate means to engage with ChatGPT output) if they do not feel comfortable having their data collected and shared as stated in these policies. \n",

            "There are ethical considerations that cannot be overlooked. First, as AI models learn from various datasets, they may inadvertently promote bias present in the data. In addition, AI-generated content may lack factuality and authenticity. Sometimes, generative AI models create facts, called hallucinations, that give the appearance of correctness. Unless the user is knowledgeable about the subject matter, the factual tone that the generative AI models use creates a sense of legitimacy for the false information. It should also be noted that AI-generated content does not acknowledge the original source of the information and struggles with properly citing sources when asked. Finally, privacy is a concern, especially given FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act). You would not want to share protected information with a generative AI application as it can store that information as part of its learning process and inadvertently reveal the confidential information through the generated responses. Consent and Data privacy need further consideration, and measures should be taken to inform students about the nature of the technology being used and ensure that their privacy rights are respected. \n",

            "[ this doc is in a different cluster # 1 >> Guidelines for Using Generative Artificial Intelligence at the George Washington University April 2023  The Promise of Generative Artificial Intelligence  The wide availability of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools, such as ChatGPT and other large language models, is driving an ongoing conversation about their academic uses.  GAI tools represent an exciting addition to the learning process that can be deployed in innovative ways to advance learning objectives.  This document provides some guidelines for the use of GAI in connection with academic work at the University.  The Office of the Provost encourages the entire University community to embrace these technologies through creative uses and applications.  Faculty are invited to make thoughtful use of GAI tools in their teaching and research.  Used properly, GAI tools can enhance the design of lessons, assignments, and assessments.  Our students will use GAI tools for the rest of their lives.  There are many productive ways in which they might use them as students, consistent with stated course policies and objectives.  Examples include: brainstorming ideas; summarizing and translating content; explaining new concepts to aid comprehension; generating counter-arguments; suggesting titles; debugging code; gathering sources; and formatting references.  Designing Assignments  Even as we are learning ourselves, we must teach our students to use GAI tools effectively and responsibly: to draft appropriate prompts; to think critically about the proper use of the tools and their possible effects on society; to evaluate their outputs with respect to accuracy, bias, and equity.  Exercises might include having students formulate effective prompts; identify superficial rhetoric in GAI-generated content; and evaluate GAI-generated arguments for soundness and  logical validity.  Students could be asked to fact-check, criticize, and/or edit GAI-generated content for credit.  The Instructional Core in the Division of Libraries and Academic Innovation has provided useful guidance for instructors on Responding to Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools.  The Office of the Provost encourages instructors to consult these resources.  Encouraging Responsible Use  For all their promise, GAI tools misused could interfere with learning objectives and impair the development of students writing, analytical, and technical skills.  There are also legitimate concerns about academic ethics, accuracy, citation of sources, and cheating.  The Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities maintains a Faculty Guide to Clarifying Academic Expectations that directly addresses the use of GAI tools in connection with academic work.  An instructor who suspects an academic integrity violation should consider submitting a Charge of Academic Dishonesty.  Note: the Law School and the School of Medicine and Health Sciences maintain their own codes of academic integrity, so the guidance contained in this document does not apply to these schools.  The Office of the Provost encourages instructors to state explicitly and affirmatively their expectations regarding student use of GAI tools.  Instructors should specify in writing the permitted and prohibited uses of GAI tools in their courses.  Instructors might 1) generally permit the use of GAI tools; 2) generally forbid their use; or 3) permit their use for certain purposes on certain assignments, but not others.  If an instructor wishes to permit certain uses of GAI tools, such uses must be set forth explicitly in the course syllabus and/or assignment instructions.  Below is some model language for the three permission options: General Permission Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools such as ChatGPT are becoming important resources in many fields and industries.  Accordingly, you are permitted to use such tools to generate content submitted for evaluation in this course, including [papers; take-home examinations; specified other assignments].  You remain responsible for all content you submit for evaluation. [Instructors might also wish to include language regarding pitfalls, such as the following:] You may use GAI tools to help generate ideas and brainstorm.  However, you should note that the material generated by these tools may be inaccurate, incomplete, or otherwise problematic.  Beware that use may also stifle your own independent thinking and creativity. [Instructors might also wish to include language regarding citation, such as the following:] If you include content (e.g., ideas, text, code, images) that was generated, in whole or in part, by Generative Artificial Intelligence tools (including, but not limited to, ChatGPT and other large language models) in work submitted for evaluation in this course, you must document and credit your source.  For example, text generated using ChatGPT-4 should include a citation such as: ChatGPT-4. (YYYY, Month DD of query). Text of your query. Generated using OpenAI. https://chat.openai.com/. Material generated using other tools should be cited accordingly.  Failure to do so in this course constitutes failure to attribute under the George Washington University Code of Academic Integrity. General Prohibition By submitting work for evaluation in this course, you represent it as your own intellectual product.  You may not submit for evaluation any content (e.g., ideas, text, code, images) that was generated, in whole or in part, by Generative Artificial Intelligence tools (including, but not limited to, ChatGPT and other large language models).  Doing so in this course constitutes cheating under the George Washington University Code of Academic Integrity. [Instructors might also wish to include language regarding papers about AI:] Although this course generally prohibits use of GAI tools, the instructor may choose to grant an exception if you propose to write a paper about [some aspect of artificial intelligence].  Such an exception must be granted in writing (e.g., email) to avoid the danger of misunderstanding. Selective Permission By submitting work for evaluation in this course, you represent it as your own intellectual product.  You may not submit for evaluation any content (e.g., ideas, text, code, images) that was generated, in whole or in part, by Generative Artificial Intelligence tools (including, but not limited to, ChatGPT and other large language models) unless the instructor has explicitly granted permission to do so.  Your instructor will explain to you the uses of GAI tools that are permitted or prohibited in this course, including on what specific assignments use of GAI tools is permitted.  Submitting content for evaluation that was produced in whole or in part by GAI tools, except for the specific purpose(s) and assignment(s) discussed and authorized by the instructor, constitutes cheating in this course under the George Washington University Code of Academic Integrity. [Instructors choosing the Selective Permission option might also wish to include some or all of the additional potential language from the General Permission and General Prohibition options, above.]   Default Rules  In the absence of explicit directions to the contrary from instructors, the following default rules apply at the University.  1. Work submitted for evaluation is represented as the students own intellectual product.  Students may not submit content (e.g., ideas, text, code, images) for evaluation that was generated, in whole or in part, by Generative Artificial Intelligence tools (such as ChatGPT and other large language models).  Doing so without instructors explicit permission constitutes cheating under the Code of Academic Integrity and is therefore prohibited.  Examples (illustrative only) of conduct that is prohibited unless explicitly permitted by the instructor:  A student types a prompt into a GAI tool and pastes all or part of the generated content into their answer on an out-of-class assessment or test.  A student types a prompt into a GAI tool and incorporates all or part of the generated content into an essay submitted for evaluation, without proper attribution to the GAI tool.  2. Students are permitted to use GAI tools to generate content that is not submitted to an instructor for evaluation.  For example, using GAI tools to study for examinations, tests, and quizzes is permitted.  Likewise, on assignments where the use of the Internet is not otherwise prohibited by the instructor, GAI tools may be used for learning, studying, and brainstorming.  Examples (illustrative only) of permitted conduct:  A student types a prompt into a GAI tool and reviews the generated content to help them study for a test.  A student types a prompt into a GAI tool and uses the generated content to help them brainstorm ideas for a term paper or research project.  3. Unless the instructor explicitly states otherwise in advance and in writing, the use of GAI tools during any assessment (e.g., examination, test, quiz) whether taken in the classroom or elsewhere, constitutes cheating under the Code of Academic Integrity and is therefore prohibited.  This prohibition includes assessments for which the use of the Internet is otherwise permitted.  Examples (illustrative only) of conduct that is prohibited unless explicitly permitted by the instructor:  While taking an out-of-class (take-home) test on which Internet use is generally permitted, a student types a prompt into a GAI tool and incorporates some or all of the generated content into their submitted answer.  While taking an in-class quiz on which Internet use is generally permitted, a student types a prompt into a GAI tool and incorporates some of the ideas generated into their submitted answer.  Before taking an in-class quiz on which Internet use is generally permitted, a student types a prompt into a GAI tool, saves the generated content to a document, and pastes some or all of the text into their submitted answer while taking the quiz.  Final Thoughts  As we enter this new technological era, the Office of the Provost encourages instructors to confer with the Instructional Core if they have questions about best practices for course design, pedagogy, assessment, and with the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities for questions about academic integrity.  Further, we appreciate that this technology is evolving, and we will update this guidance as circumstances require. \n",
